# Serverless Data Processing Workflow on AWS

This project demonstrates a fully serverless data processing pipeline using AWS services. It allows clients to upload data via a REST API and processes it through an event-driven architecture using AWS Step Functions and Lambda.

##  Architecture Overview

### Components:
- **Client**: Web or mobile app that triggers the workflow.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Handles HTTP requests from clients.
- **Amazon S3**: Stores incoming files or data payloads.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes backend logic at various stages.
- **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestrates the flow across multiple Lambda functions.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: Stores structured data (e.g., metadata, logs, results).
- **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**: Captures logs for observability and debugging.

##  Workflow

1. A client sends a request to the **API Gateway**.
2. The request payload is stored in **Amazon S3**.
3. An **AWS Lambda** function is triggered to initiate the **Step Functions workflow**.
4. **Step Functions** orchestrate a series of **Lambda** functions for:
   - Data validation
   - Transformation
   - Enrichment
   - Final storage or logging
5. Results are saved in **Amazon S3** or **DynamoDB**, and logs are pushed to **CloudWatch**.
